Discrete Event Simulation of airplane boarding strategies

This is the code for a project for a course Simulation Analysis and Optimization I followed in 2023. In this project we simulated boarding times of various boarding strategies for an aircraft using the Discrete Event Simulation (DES) framework. The stochasticity in the simulation allowed to not only find which strategy is fastest on average, but also with what certainty the boarding time does not exceed a certain length.
